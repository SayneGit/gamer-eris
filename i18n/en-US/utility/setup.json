  "NETWORK_TITLE": "**Step 2:** Would you like to setup the Social Network feature on this server❓",
  "NETWORK_DESC": "This feature will allow you to be able to post messages on your #wall channel and be able to have everyone follow it.

Furthermore, sometimes users leave and rejoin to try and remove their  muted roles but Gamer bot makes sure to give the role back to them when they rejoin.",
  "MUTE_COMPLETE": "The mute system has been setup. Amazing. Now users will be able to be muted and unable to bypass it. To learn more about how to mute you can use the `.help mute` or `.help setmute` commands.",
  "PROFANITY_TITLE": "**Step 5:** Would you like to set up the profanity filter system❓",
  "PROFANITY_DESC": "This will automatically add all the words into the filter from a list of profanity words. Gamer's profanity system goes above and beyond any normal system. We don't just delete messages but we filter them and resend them. We hide the parts of the message that was profane with $$$ characters. This allows users to continue their conversation without having to retype the entire message. Imagine someone types a paragraph to give some feedback on your server and some bots just delete that entire message saying because of 1 word. This user now gets upset that all their effort to provide help and honest feedback is wasted and have to type it all again. Gamer makes sure that conversations stay intact and continue while maintaing a healthy atmoshphere in your servers by hiding the profanity.",
